* A way up to the float lands.

* This mod generates a 1 km mountain / tower thing at a chosen position in a newly generated chunk. The lower section has a hollow core surrounded by caves and ledges that help with carving steps to the top. When generated over water the hollow core can be used for jumping down the last 300m.

* By default this generates near x = 0, z = 272 for testing in new worlds, for any other use you will need to edit the co-ordinate parameters to an ungenerated location.

* Constructed from stone or red desert stone dependant on biome, when on a biome transition there is a smooth transition of material creating red stripes.

* The structure is limited to y = -32 to 1008, 13 chunks in height, and occupies an area of 2x2 chunks. This large area allows a wider structure if wanted, controlled by parameter HGRAD. Parameter VGRAD controls how fast the structure tapers with altitude.

* The lower chunks can take up to 2 minutes to generate depending on tower width.

* No new nodes.

* Grass and trees often spawn on the structure, caused by a cool mapgen bug.

* I refer to the Mount Meru of ancient eastern cosmology.
